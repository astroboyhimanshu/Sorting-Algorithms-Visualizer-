# Sorting-Algorithms-Visualizer-
Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
Computer graphics is an exciting and rapidly growing field that involves creating and manipulating visual 
content on a computer. Sorting algorithms are an essential part of computer science and have numerous 
applications in the fields of data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. In this project, I 
combine these two fields by creating a sorting algorithm visualizer in OpenGL C++. 

The project aims to supply a graphical representation of various sorting algorithms such as selection 
sort and bubble sort. The visualizer will allow users to interact with the algorithms, see their behavior, and understand their working principles in a more 
intuitive way. The user will be able to generate a random sequence of numbers within the required range 
and see the sorting algorithm in action. 

OpenGL C++ is an ideal tool for this project as it is a powerful and efficient graphics library that can 
create complex 3D graphics and interactive applications. The library supplies a robust set of functions and 
tools to create stunning graphics and user interfaces, making it perfect for a sorting algorithm visualizer. 
Overall, this project combines the power of computer graphics and sorting algorithms to create an 
interactive, educational, and engaging experience for users. It will not only help users understand sorting 
algorithms but also provide them with a fun and visually stimulating way to explore computer science
